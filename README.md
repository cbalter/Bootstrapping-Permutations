# Bootstrapping-Permutations

This was a class exam where we were given a dataset of The Office. 
The data set included characters and their associated lines. There were 570566 observations (each single word spoken by character)

I formulated my own hypotheses that tested who said, "Michael" more in the show, Dwight or Jim. Inspiration came from season 3 episode 20.

I focused on using dplyr piping to organize the data. 

Bootstrapping and permutation testing was executed by the replication function.
